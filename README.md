Money Transfer Application with a Vue.js Front-end

This is the front end to a money transfer app! It uses Vue.js and bootstrap on the front end and a Java/ PostgreSQL on the back-end to support transactions between users. New users can register and are given a starting balance of $1000(so generous, I know). They can then search from a list of users, select a user and either send them money or request money. A history of all transfers is kept and the user can view either all their transfers or all their pending transfers from there.
